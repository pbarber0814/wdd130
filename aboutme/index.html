        <p>Hey everyone! I am a first semester student here at BYUI! I am a CyberSecurity major with a minor in Business Management. I hope to get a job working with companies to manage and/or develop their information security systems and processes, but there are many opportunities for us CS majors out there. I love Basketball and Music. I ran Track and Cross Country in High School and participated in Choir!</p>
        <p>I am not married nor do I have children, but I am looking forward to that part of my life. I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for my entire life, and I served my mission in Ohio! I got to be in Columbus, Cleveland, and Akron. I spent a lot of time visiting the Kirtland Sites and the Kirtland Temple! I love just about everything our prophet Russel M Nelson says, but recently his counsel to "Think Celestial" has been sticking with me.</p>
        <p>I see many advantages for getting a degree in Web Design and other Computer Science areas. For starters, the world of technolog is taking over everything. Every single job and company needs individuals who understand Web Space and how to use the technology that we have access too. Not only is this kind of job security comforting, most companies are willing to pay quiote nicely for individuals with these skills. </p>
